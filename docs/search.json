And what better way to start than documenting my set up process?\nThis first post is not too exciting; just some basic setup. There are many ways to set up a Quarto website and they’re well documented at quarto.org. I’m therefore not explaining things in detail for this post, just recording the steps I took.\nThe next few posts will dig into the nitty gritty details of customizing my site, which is a bit more of an adventure."

Inside each of those is an index.qmd file that contains the contents for that post.\n\n\nThe organization of your Quarto repository is reflected in the organization of your site.\n\nThe index.qmd located in the root directory becomes your homepage (e.g. myblog.io)\nAn index.qmd located in /posts/my-aweseome-post will become the page located at myblog.io/posts/my-awesome-post\n\nFor now, we’ll talk about the homepage, but you could add content in exactly the same way to any other page. There’s nothing “special” about the home page."

    "text": "What’s in an index.qmd?\nAn index.qmd file is a standard qmd file, containing a YAML header followed by markdown content. A couple of things to note:\n\nQuarto provides many YAML options for customizing the output for an HTML page. Most of these options are applicable to web pages. An index.qmd file should contain any options that are specific to that page. Site-wide options, (e.g. css) can instead be set in _quarto.yml.\nindex.qmd files can be a little unusual in that they don’t necessarily need to contain much (or any) content. Instead, for some pages, you use YAML settings to tell Quarto how to automatically populate the page. This is particularly useful for “listing” content - Quarto can generate e.g. a nice-looking list of all your blog posts, or a card for each of your projects."
