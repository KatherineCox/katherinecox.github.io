And what better way to start than documenting my set up process?\nThis first post is not too exciting; just some basic setup. There are many ways to set up a Quarto website and they’re well documented at quarto.org.\nThe next few posts will dig into the nitty gritty details of customizing my site, which is a bit more of an adventure."
